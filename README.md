# Landing Page project

I created an entire web page for a fictional coffee shop.

Based on [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/landing-page) assignment.

Special thanks to the creators of the beautiful images I used to build this web page:
